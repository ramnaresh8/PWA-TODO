# Assignment: Progressive Web App (PWA)

### Develop a Progressive Web App (PWA) that demonstrates the use of service workers for offline functionality, caching, and push notifications.

Additionally, you should implement a few additional features to enhance the overall user experience.

## Assignment Details:

Create a simple web application, such as a blog or a to-do list, that can function both online and offline.

# The application should include the following features:

## Service Worker Implementation:

Implement a service worker to handle caching of static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).Ensure the app works offline by serving cached content. Add a mechanism to update the cache when there are changes to the assets. Offline Functionality: The app should display a custom offline page when the user is not connected to the internet. Ensure data entered while offline is stored locally and synced with the server once the connection is restored.

## Push Notifications:

Implement push notifications to alert users of new content or updates. Ensure that notifications are customizable by the user.

## Additional Features:

Responsive Design: Ensure the app is fully responsive and works across different devices and screen sizes.

Background Sync: Implement background sync to handle data synchronization when the user comes back online.

Lazy Loading of Images: Implement lazy loading for images to improve performance.

Custom Web App Manifest: Create a web app manifest that allows the app to be added to the home screen on mobile devices.
Ensure the manifest includes custom icons and a splash screen.

Submission Requirements: Source Code: Upload the complete source code to a GitHub repository.

Deployment: Deploy the application using a service like Netlify or GitHub Pages, and provide the live URL ( optional ).

## Evaluation Criteria:

Functionality: How well the app meets the requirements. Code Quality: Cleanliness, organization, and comments in the code.
User Experience: Responsiveness, design, and ease of use. Innovation: Any additional features or enhancements beyond the assignment's scope.
